### Visualization 1
- It is unclear what question this visualization is trying to answer - do we want to be able to tell which strategy is best for an individual product, or which total is the highest? This would change how the data should be presented.
- The colors could cause issues for someone who is colorblind.
- It's hard to tell at a glance which strategy has the highest total by looking at the line.
- Using a line chart for the total is not ideal since it implies that it is something changing over time, which does not seem to be the case since it is by strategy.
- The two y-axes are confusing generally, and it is unclear which axis applies to which data elements. 

# Notes on my design:
If we care more about which strategy has the highest total, I would present the information in a stacked bar chart. This makes the totals easier to compare while removing the noise of the variation between the different product bars.


### Visualization 2
- There are no labels on the y-axis to show what units are being measured.
- The percentages seem to be differences (since they are negative and greater than 100), but there is no context about what is being compared.
- The red numbers seem to be totals, but it is not made clear by the visualization.
- It's unclear what the purpose of the visualization is.
- There are a lot of numbers that require reading and are distracting, and also a lot of colors.

# Notes on my design:
I would make a separate grouped bar chart for each category or product. That way the numbers within the bars would not be necessary anymore. I would include a marker to show whatever the comparison that the percentages are supposed to represent. I would also simplify the colors and instead label each bar.

### Visualization 3
- It is hard to tell the difference in the size of the circles for the average spending per person by item, so that reading the amounts is required. In the same section, greeting cards do not have an amount provided.
- Using pumpkins for the annual spending is an unneccessary graphic element that does not contribute to the understanding of the amount.
- Not only are circles hard to tell the relative size of, the 2009 pumpkin looks deceptively small condsidering that spending that year was still 4.7 billion, which is about 2/3 of the years before and after.
- The bar chart for costume spending is a fitting choice of visualization for this information.
- The clip art is distracting and the circlular one seems like it should be part of the average spending per person, but it is not.

# Notes on my design:
In my visualization, I made the types of charts more uniform and oriented consistently. I took out the bar for the percentage of adults participating in Halloween, since that seems like it could be represented equally effectively with just a number. I kept the themed colors but tried to simplify overall and remove the excessive graphics.
