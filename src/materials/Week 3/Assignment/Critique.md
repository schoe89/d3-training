### Part 4 Critique
- It feels a little redundant to have the year after every month labeled on the x-axis. Instead, the title could say 2014 (instead of last year, which isn't a very useful description).
- The numbers on top of the bars are distracting and seem like extra ink without adding any new data.
- The two y-axes are confusing generally and can be misleading, since the one on the right starts at 100k.
- Using a line and a bar implies some kind of more intrinsic difference in the kind of data being represented, which there is not.
- The key does not have a very helpful description of what the data is ("OrderID" and "Amount" are vague).

# Notes on my design:
I split the bar chart into two separate ones, for number of sale and Euro amount of sales. It seems like there is definitely a relationship between the two charts, so it would be interesting to come up with a way to show that.
