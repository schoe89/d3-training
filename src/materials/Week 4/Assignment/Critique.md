### Part 3 Critique
- There is no title to give the visualization context. Are these percents? What does it mean?
- Having the bars go in opposite directions makes it really hard to compare the democrate/republican amounts for a single subject. For example, without the amounts labeled, I would not be able to tell that the jobs bars were different sizes.
- The fact that the number labels are necessary makes the ink to data ratio higher than it would have to be.
- I don't like the inconsistent locations of the issue labels.

# Notes on my design:
I created a bar chart that allows for comparison across both parties and issues.
