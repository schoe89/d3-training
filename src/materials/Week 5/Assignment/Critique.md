### Part 3 Critique
- The bar chart of deaths is visually dramatic while accurately representing the data.
- The notes of events happening at the time provide useful context for certain spikes and drops in the data.
- The circle charts aren't great for just being able to look at and see the relative differences, and the labels required to help with that make the data to ink ratio lower.
- For the section that is showing how people died, it would be helpful to show for how many deaths the reason is not known for context.
- The map doesn't give any information about the population of each area and how the number of deaths relates to that.

# Notes on my design:
I kept the main layout and bar chart, and just made some changes to the smaller surrounding charts to address the critiques above.
